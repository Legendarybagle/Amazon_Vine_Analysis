# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## overview of analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to clean the data with a main purpose of comparing if whether a user paid for vine affected their review scores at all

## results
* there were 94 total vine reviews and 40471 total non-vine reviews
* 48 of the vine reviews were 5 stars, 15663 of the non-vine reviews were 5 stars
* vine reviews were 51% 5 star, 38% of non-vine reviews were 5 start

## summary
Based on the data above, it does seem like users with vine are more likely to give a movie a 5 star rating. this could be an inherit bias in the vine system that make speople think they enjoyed the movie more, or it could be that people who like movies more are more likely to get vine. an analysis on comparing both 4 and one star reviews from both could show more abour how skewed the data is from vine to non vine.
